# Dynamic Forces in Physics

A force is a push or pull on an object. It can make things move, stop, or change direction

### Forces and Impulses

#### Force

- **Definition:** An interaction that tends to change the motion of an object, described as a push or a pull.
- **Measurement:** Newtons (N)
- **Role:** The cause of acceleration, as described by Newton's second law (F = ma)
- **Example:** Pushing a box across the floor. The push is the force

#### Impulse

- **Definition:** The integral of force of time, meaning it's the totalin an object's momentum caused by a force acting over a specific duration
- **Formula:** $J = F \times \Delta t$ (Where J is impulse, F is average force, and $\Delta t$ is the time interval)
- **Role:** It is the cause of a change in momentum and can be used to calculate the average force of a collision if the change in momentum and time are known
- **Example:** Hitting a baseball. The force of the bat hitting the ball is applied over a short time, creating a large impulse that changes the ball's momentum significantly
